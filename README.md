Snappy is a PHP library allowing thumbnail, snapshot or PDF generation from a url or a html page.
It uses the excellent webkit-based [wkhtmltopdf and wkhtmltoimage](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/)
available on OSX, linux, windows.

You will have to download wkhtmltopdf `0.12.x` in order to use Snappy.

Please, check [FAQ](doc/faq.md) before opening a new issue. Snappy is a tiny wrapper around wkhtmltox, so lots of issues are already answered, resolved or wkhtmltox ones.

## wkhtmltopdf binary as composer dependencies

If you want to download wkhtmltopdf and wkhtmltoimage with composer, you can require the [michael-schaefer-eu/wkhtmltox](https://github.com/michael-schaefer-eu/wkhtmltox) package:

```bash
$ composer require michael-schaefer-eu/wkhtmltox
```

And then you can use it (with PSR4 Autoloader):

```php
<?php
use Knp\Snappy\Pdf;
use Knp\Snappy\Image;
use Wkhtmltox\Wkhtmltopdf;
use Wkhtmltox\Wkhtmltoimage;

$snappyPdf = new Pdf(Wkhtmltopdf::BIONICAMD64);
$snappyImage = new Image(Wkhtmltoimage::BIONICAMD64);
```

_Info:_ The michael-schaefer-eu/wkhtmltox package contains the latest wkhtmltopdf and wkhtmltoimage binaries for Ubuntu bionic 18.04, amd64 and i386 architectures. If you need binaries for any other version or OS, you can search on [packagist.org](https://packagist.org/?query=wkhtmltopdf).

## Some use cases

If you want to generate table of contents and you want to use custom XSL stylesheet, do the following:

```php
<?php
$snappy = new Pdf('/path/to/binary');

$snappy->setOption('toc', true);
$snappy->setOption('xsl-style-sheet', 'http://path/to/stylesheet.xsl') //or local file;

$snappy->generateFromHtml('<p>Some content</p>', 'test.pdf');
```

## Bugs & Support

If you found a bug please fill a detailed issue with all the following points.
If you need some help, please at least provide a complete reproducer so we could help you based on facts rather than assumptions.

* OS and its version
* Wkhtmltopdf, its version and how you installed it
* A complete reproducer with relevant php and html/css/js code

If your reproducer is big, please try to shrink it. It will help everyone to narrow the bug.
