# Frequently asked questions

###### *Q*: It does not work and everything is broken.

*A*: Please, try to execute the command manually in your shell. Snappy is a thin PHP wrapper and most likely your issue is with wkhtmltopdf itself or is already described in this FAQ. If not, feel free to open the issue in Snappy issue tracker.

How to get the command to execute - 

```php
var_dump($snappy->getCommand('http://google.com', 'test.pdf'), array('some' => 'option'));
```

Please, note that wkhtmltopdf takes only input url or file name as a source.


###### *Q*: My tables are broken when it is rendered on multiple pages with break.

*A*: Add ```thead``` and ```tbody``` tags. Add the following css 
```css
table, tr, td, th, tbody, thead, tfoot {
    page-break-inside: avoid !important;
}
```


###### *Q*: I have a PNG with a transparent background. When generating a PDF, the background turns black.

*A*: It is wkhtmltopdf bug as described in https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/issues/2214. You should update wkhtmltopdf to at least 0.12.3-dev


###### *Q*: Is there a way to secure the pdf so it can't be edited?

*A*:  There is no way to add a password via wkhtmltopdf, but there is a way via other linux tools like pdftk


###### *Q*: We are using wkhtmltopdf to export html to pdf. It breaks the HTML in two pages of pdf. Can we add a break?

*A*: It is known problem of `wkhtmltopdf`. You can use css `page-break-after`, like:
```html
<style type="text/css">
    .page {
        overflow: hidden;
        page-break-after: always;
    }
</style>

<div class="page">
   new page
</div>
```


###### *Q*: It says `wkhtmltopdf: cannot connect to X server` or `xvfb-run: error: Xvfb failed to start.`

*A*: Please, check your `wkhtmltopdf` version. It is recommended to use at least `0.12.2.1` and what is important - starting from `wkhtmltopdf >= 0.12.2` it doesn't require X server or emulation anymore. You can download new version from http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html or install via composer for Linux servers as stated in [README](https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy#wkhtmltopdf-binary-as-composer-dependencies). If there is no possibility to update `wkhtmltopdf`, please check http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9604625/wkhtmltopdf-cannot-connect-to-x-server


###### *Q*: My PDF is always generated for a small screen resolution\I always receive a mobile version.

*A*: It is well-known issue of wkhtmltopdf, you can check https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/issues/1508. One of solutions is to use xvbf and to setup xvbf resolution to desired one.

###### *Q*: My chars with accents in HTML document are not correctly rendered.

*A*: Make sure that you have set `<meta charset="UTF-8" />`

###### *Q*: My chars with accents passed to wkhtmltopdf options are not correctly rendered, i.e. `footer-right => 'Página [page] de [toPage]'` is converted to 'PÃ¡gina 1 de 1'.

*A*: The answer is long here. We use `escapeshellarg` (and Symfony/Process as well) function to escape all the option value passed to `wkhtmltox`. `escapeshellarg` makes its escape based on server locale, so if you are  experiencing this issue - you can set 
```php
setlocale(LC_CTYPE, 'es_ES.UTF-8')
``` 

or any locale which is suitable for you. You should take into account that if given locale is not configured on the server - you will still have an issue. Check your locales installed via running
```bash
locale -a
```
If the needed locale is missing on the server - you should install/configure it.
